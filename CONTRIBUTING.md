This project uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and npm workspaces to work with `react-wordpress-comments` and see a demo.

## Prerequisites

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 16 must be installed for npm workspaces to work correctly.

## Installation

- Running `npm install` in the root of the repo will install all dependencies.

## Demo Development Server

Dev server is serving our demo website that renders a component.

- `npm start` will start server at [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) or another URL prompted in your console. Updating code will trigger hot reload of what you see on the screen.

## Building

If you want to build, use these command:

- `npm run build` will build the component and also bundle the demo app.
